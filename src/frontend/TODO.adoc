== Component

* `constructor` and `public onPropsUpdated`
** take `(props: Props)` as input.
** `this.mutableState = DashboardComponent.calculateState(props);`
** `onPropsUpdated` can add remove subcomponents
** cascade /construction and/ props to sub-components
** Does not call render etc at all.
** No async work, just simple state calculation.

* `private static calculateState(props, state)`
** validates props and state
** returns new state
** might throw an error, but only in exceptional cases that the app should not recover from.
** Typical errors should be reflected in the state. `state.getError()`.

* `public render()`
** Uses only the state to render the component (modify the DOM).
** Cascades the "signal" to subcomponents.
** No other side effects.

* `public async refresh()`
** another way to update the state
** Async work allowed here.
** Typically: fetches data from the backend.
** Cascades the "signal" to subcomponents?
** Should we allow `render()` here? ... probably not, I have no idea.

== TODOs

* Components: Pass the complete `ComponentState` to the `ComponentDom` instance
* ComponentDom does the `document.title = ` thing
* Move some of the code in `index.html` to a Main component.
A main navigation component, that uses the Router internally?
Or just a simple component that renders the navigation bar?
* Global error handling - redirect to an error page
* Some event handler
* Input form
* Components: method for parse props
* Async fetching
** AbortController
** When fetching is done, validate job still "relevant"
** Debouncing - only fetch when user has stopped typing
** Throttling - only fetch every 500ms
** Caching - don't fetch if we already have the data
